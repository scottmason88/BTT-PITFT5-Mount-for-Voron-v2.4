# BTT-PITFT5-Mount-for-Voron-v2.4

Mount for [Big Tree Tech PI TFT 5 Inch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F1WMQ1J/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_X6HDGQYNXN14MC008QEW?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) for the Voron 2.4, using 2.2 mount. Along with the screen you'll need a [longer ribbon cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I6LJ19G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), as the screen comes with a 2" cable since it's designed to be used with the Raspberry Pi attached to the back.

Special thanks to OrkusMG for doing most of the work on this, I just modified it for use with a different screen.<br>[Link to his original project](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/legacy_printers/printer_mods/OrkusMG/Waveshare5inchHDMILCDscreenCover)
